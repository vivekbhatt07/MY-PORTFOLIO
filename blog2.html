            In my childhood, I generally play games on my computer that time
            mobile games were not that much popular and exciting to play. Also,
            we don't possess mobile phones that time surely. In PC, I have
            played many games like Max Payne, Total Overdose, Prince of Persia,
            GTA vice city etc. This list is very huge.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            But as I reach my adulthood, my pc became old with low specification
            unable to run high-end games which became a major reason for me to
            stop playing games on my PC. After sometime, pubg was launched in
            India. I got excited about it and wanted to play it. I played it for
            many years and enjoyed it a lot with friends. I think It created a
            better bonding between me and my friends to connect even if we are
            far away from each other.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            Everthing was fine until it got banned and everyone was soo sad
            regarding it. But it came again after a long period of altleast 1.5
            year rebranded as "BGMI".
