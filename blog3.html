            Everybody has their way of living life but not always the right way.
            The society in which we live mainly focuses on the wealth and
            achievements of an individual that they achieved. No one analyses
            the reason and hardships behind their success but cares about the
            rewards they get in return. Like sheep, everyone follows them
            blindly. Now, you might be thinking about what I have achieved to
            give a lecture to someone regarding this. But do you know to write a
            blog sometimes you don't need to be an achiever, you can do it for
            fun? Also, someone said, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000
            ways that won't work.". Surely, I will not show you the 10,000
            things that will not make your life on track but some limited things
            that I learned and implemented as I keep growing and upskilling
            which will keep you on track.

          <h4 class="text-left">BALANCE IN EVERYTHING</h4>
          <p class="text-left">
            Balance is an important aspect of life whether it is taken in
            respect of eating, studying, relationship, gaming, or other things.
            This aspect I lacked when I was preparing for my Chartered
            Accountant Foundation paper. The paper has four subjects, i.e,
            English, Business, Maths, and Law. Each subject has 100 marks each,
            making it a paper of a total of 400 marks. And there were two
            conditions to pass the exam, i.e, get at least 40% marks in each
            subject to pass individually in subjects and a total of 200 of all
            the subjects. I was good at maths, in comparison to other subjects
            as the other three were theory subjects which you have to learn and
            I am terrible at that. So, I gave most of my time to maths leaving
            behind the others. The situation concluded that I was unable to pass
            the exam.

          <h4 class="text-left">ONE STEP AT A TIME RULE</h4>
          <p class="text-left">
            Most of the students don't understand the essence of achieving a
            long-term goal by taking step-by-step movements toward it.
            Sometimes, it does not matter what your pace is but it is important
            to start before it gets too late to begin your journey. We can break
            a big task into small chunks and by completing those small chunks we
            can make them stepping stones on our way to our main goal. This
            aspect was gained by me when I started learning web development. In
            web development, people divide their projects into small tasks for
            each day. These small tasks are assigned to each individual to
            complete. On completion of all these small tasks with everyday
            effort result in the creation of the project. Also, someone said,
            "Big things have small beginnings."
