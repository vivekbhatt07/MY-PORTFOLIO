          <p class="text-left">
            Since my B.com graduation, I had been in a dilemma about what to do
            after graduation as there were many options to pursue to decide my
            career journey. So, I was on the track of my life where I needed to
            choose the best among the available alternatives to my career path.
            Firstly, I made up my mind to pursue a government job as it seems
            secure. But the cost of getting it is to start from zero and study
            consistently. I don't mind doing hard work in anything but the
            problem with me is that I am a slow learner and takes time to grasp
            things.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">INDORE</h4>
          <p class="text-left">
            While there was no vacancy for any government jobs, my parents send
            me to Indore city, where my brother works at a startup company as a
            Front End Developer. So he also got me there just to learn not on
            internship. As he told me that Internships will not be beneficial
            for me as I don't know the basics of programming languages. So
            firstly, I had to learn the basics by myself and if I face any
            difficulties then I can seek help from anybody in the office. The
            people in the office were very supportive, they helped me in every
            aspect possible.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">GETTING INTO LEVEL ONE</h4>
          <p class="text-left">
            So, I started learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript from
            the Tanay Pratap Level 0. The sole reason for me to choose this
            course was to enter into Level 1. Starting parts of the course were
            understandable but as soon as I reached further on my journey,
            learning became a lot more difficult as Tanay introduced a few
            intermediate-level concepts (promise) of Javascript which were hard
            for someone who doesn't know the basics. I stopped the course
            sometime as I don't want to learn things without understanding due
            to which that year I cannot apply for Level 1.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">JOURNEY OF BASICS</h4>
          <p class="text-left">
            For learning the basics I reached the youtube platform instead of
            some Udemy course as I only wanted to learn the basics at that time.
            There I started watching the video of Vikram Thapa who had taught
            the basics so well that I feel building some confidence in writing
            basic-level javascript. In my free time, aside from Javascript, I
            used to practice CSS as I was very fond of CSS back then.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">VACANCY AVAILABLE</h4>
          <p class="text-left">
            While I was busy learning new technology. I heard from my aunt that
            vacancy for Police is available and that I should apply for that as
            soon as possible. I was excited to hear about that but felt a little
            confused about how to manage time for the preparation for both
            programming and police preparation. So, I used to leave the office
            at 6:00 PM early to go to the nearby ground for running and at night
            to study for the police written exam.
