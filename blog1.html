            Since my B.com graduation, I had been in a dilemma about what to do
            after graduation as there were many options to pursue to decide my
            career journey. So, I was on track of my life where I needed to
            choose the best among the available alternatives to my career path.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            Firstly, I made up my mind to pursue goverment job as it seems
            secure. But the cost of getting it is to start from zero and study
            consisitantly. And also in preparing for any government exams there
            comes a fear what if we did'nt pass then at the end we remain empty
            handed. I don't mind in doing hardwork in anything but the problem
            with me is that I am a slow learner and takes time to grasp things.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            While there were no vacancy for any government jobs, my parents send
            me to Indor city, where my brother works at a company. There my
            brother work as a Front End Developer so he also get me there just
            to learn not on internship. As he told me that Internships will not
            be beneficial for me as I don't know the basics of programming
            languages .So firstly, I had to learn it by myself and if I face any
            difficulties then I can ask anybody in the office.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            The people in the office were very supportive, they helped me in
            every aspect possible. I started learning from Tanay Pratap videos
            from neog camp which I had started watching on November, 2021, so
            that I will get admission in neog.camp. But the topics covered seems
            to go over my head and I got frustrated as it was mentioned beginner
            but it seems tough. Due to which I did'nt get admission that year as
            I was unable to complete the projects mentioned in his level 0
            course.
